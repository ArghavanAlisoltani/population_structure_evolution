# subsampling_Greedy_100.R

## Purpose
Placeholder script for greedy subsampling workflows; the file is currently empty and contains no executable code.【F:scripts/subsampling_Greedy_100.R†L1-L1】

## How to run
- No actions are required yet. Populate the script with your subsampling logic before execution, then run via `Rscript scripts/subsampling_Greedy_100.R`.

## Notes
- Add usage notes and dependencies when implementation is added.


## Additional notes
- These steps assume paths and filenames can be adjusted to match your environment.
- When re-running, consider versioning outputs (e.g., suffixes) to avoid overwriting prior results.
- Record software versions and key parameters alongside outputs for reproducibility.
