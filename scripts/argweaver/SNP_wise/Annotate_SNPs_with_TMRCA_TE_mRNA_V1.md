# Annotate_SNPs_with_TMRCA_TE_mRNA_V1.py

## Purpose
Describe what this script does and the expected inputs/outputs.

## Example
```bash
python scripts/argweaver/SNP_wise/Annotate_SNPs_with_TMRCA_TE_mRNA_V1.py --help
```


## Additional notes
- These steps assume paths and filenames can be adjusted to match your environment.
- When re-running, consider versioning outputs (e.g., suffixes) to avoid overwriting prior results.
- Record software versions and key parameters alongside outputs for reproducibility.
